# RaylibFlappyBird

This is a port of my Pygame recreation of Flappy Bird to the the [python bindings for the Raylib graphics library,](https://github.com/electronstudio/raylib-python-cffi) originally written in C.

## Current bugs

- Bird rotation not implemented
- Large and small score rendering is bugged
- Secret window icon not updating
- Bird hitbox is too large/small?
- Textures are constantly being reloaded, causing memory leaks
